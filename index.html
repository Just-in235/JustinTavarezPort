    <h1>About Me</h1>  
    <h2>Future Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>Hi I'm Justin and if you're reading this that means you wanna learn more about me. So to start off  I really enjoy technology, music and art, although most importantly for me is getting out of my comfort zone and exploring new types of things that life has to offer. I know somewhat cheesy but I've recently come around to doing it and it's completely changed the way I look at life. I'm still young and I have lots to learn but I am 100% prepared for it. <br><br> Through the experience I've gained throughtout High School and Internships I learned that later on in the future I want to become a Computer Scientist or a Software Engineering. Hopefully throughout my college journey I will gain even more experience in this field so I can accomplish my goals. <br><br>Apart from my goals and school I really enjoy expressing myself through multple forms. I enjoy drawing when I get the chance and I am really interested in fashion so I usually express myself through the clothes I wear. Another hobby of mine is listening to music and I am in the process of learning the Guitar so one day I can make my own.<br><br> Three words to describe myself would be <font color="#17d1ac"> Independent</font>, <font color="#17d1ac"> Chill</font> and <font color="#17d1ac"> fearless</font>.</p>
